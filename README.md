**Code Challenge Problem #1**

To kick off the STG code challenge we are going to start with an easier String parsing problem.

Create a method or function that takes all of the numbers out of an alphanumerical String and return the numbers found summed together.  Extra points for not using String.toInt(strValue) (or whatever method your language uses) language functionality but convert the number to an int manually.

So for the following string "dywi23jssi88sjdhj1" your method would return 22 as an int type. For any questions send them to dan.bunker@stgutah.com.  Happy coding!
